# Arduino_LED_Pong

My idea is to use an LED display that has individual bulbs and a joystick to create the arcade game pong or maybe snake. The most challenging part of this project will be connecting the individual bulbs in a way that can create a cohesive image. The joystick input will have to be converted into the turning off and on of the bulbs to simulate movement. The code for the actual pong game doesn't seem to be too complex, most of the work will come in simulating movement. The joystick has 4 directions of movement which isn't needed for pong but is needed for a game like snake. I will potentially change to buttons if I stick with pong. Creating a simple AI that you can play against doesn't seem too difficult but I think it would be more interesting to instead have two sets of inputs so 4 buttons, so that two people could play against each other. Given that the display is so small there is a potential of connecting multiple displays to create a larger display. If I have time left over I can add speakers and music and use joysticks instead of buttons.
